# Cosmac-VIP-Color-Board-VP590

A Cosmac VIP board that gives the VIP color capabilities based on the CDP 1862 color chip using CHIP8X firmware.

The current schematic was redrawn from 2 sources, Bob Hayes VIPER Volume 3 Issue 2 - 16 1979 and Ed Keefe 2010 (https://www.cosmacvip.com/).

For the card to work there needs to be non destruct modifications to the main VIP board, which includes removing U3 and U4, and relocating U2, the CDP1861 to the color board.

Refer to the VP580_VP585_VP590_VP595.pdf instruction manual in documentations.

A copy of the CHIP8x software to enable color is also included in the firmware section.
